RPEnsemble 0.2 errata
- Explicit references to global variables Train.Class, Test.Class
- Spelling error ("methed") in documentation of RPParallel
- RPModel(4) throws error:
Error in readChar(con, 5L, useBytes = TRUE) : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In readChar(con, 5L, useBytes = TRUE) :
  cannot open compressed file 'R.RData', probable reason 'No such file or directory'
(wrong/hardcoded path to data file? I can directly load R.RData, so the file is there in the package.)
- RPModel(5) not implemented, although it's pretty simple. We can put in my implementation?
- RPalpha: G.n.1 and G.n.2 are between 1 and 2 (instead of between 0 and 1), although this is accounted for in
  optimise()
